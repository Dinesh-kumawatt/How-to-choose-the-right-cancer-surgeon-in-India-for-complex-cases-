# How-to-choose-the-right-cancer-surgeon-in-India-for-complex-cases-

Choosing right surgeon is very important. First, check if they are trained from good cancer hospital like Tata Memorial or AIIMS. Also see if they do the surgery you need—like robotic or HIPEC. Look at experience, patient reviews, and how many such surgeries they do every year. Meet the doctor, ask all questions, and see if they explain things in simple way. Also ask about the full team—cancer care needs support from diet, chemo, radiation team also. Don’t just look at name or fame—comfort and clarity matter too.
